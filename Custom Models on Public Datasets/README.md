### This folder contains progress of developing models for already existing **Datasets** like
-TrashCAN 1.0 (instance version & material version)
-Trash_ICRA19
-New-Plastic-Test - v5 final-test-dataset
-Fish.v1-416x416

This subfolder also shows the progress of development of the final model over time (bottom to top)

# Models used
Aiming at the problem of insufficient storage space and limited computing ability of underwater mobile devices, an underwater garbage detection algorithm is proposed.

## Yolo V6s
PROS: Acceptable accuracy, Good detection.
CONS: High Computation time, Couldnt detect properly from real-life unseen data (overfit due to training data's size, captured too much noise from each image)

## YOLOv5s
PROS: Good detection, Acceptable Accuracy.
CONS: Training required high amount of GPU RAM (11.8GB) therefore high computation cost.

## RCNN
PROS: Acceptable Detection of trash but bad segregation.
CONS: Poor Accuracy, Outdated, High train time.
